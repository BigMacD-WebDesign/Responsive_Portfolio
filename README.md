# Responsive_Portfolio
2nd Homework assignment

-Created my own stylesheet css in order to use backgrounds and styles of my own to form the site to my liking.

-For all three .html sheets, I used Bootstrap CSS to style the images and format positioning.

-Used the JS script in Bootstrap and that allowed the links to become clickable when the responsive screen shrank and presented the hamburger options.
